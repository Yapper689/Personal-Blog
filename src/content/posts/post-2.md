Why is he keeping music to himself? 

This guy is sitting on a goldmine of unreleased music, some of which could probably redefine genres, some even changes my life!, and yet he chooses to fucking hoard like a disgusting little hoarder.

Maybe he's just got such an inflated ego that he thinks only he deserves to hear the best of his own work. Snippets of unreleased tracks, leaks that send the average me sky high, and what does he do? Fucking Nothing. He sits on it, tweaking and reworking until the essence of the original brilliance is all lost.

Artists evolve, sure, but with Ye, it feels like Iâ€™m constantly chasing shadows. He drops an album, and within days, there are snippets of even better tracks that didn't make the cut. What's the point? Why tease with brilliance only to deliver mediocrity in comparison?

And let's not forget the endless delays. The hype builds up, the anticipation is almost unbearable, and then... nothing. Radio silence or, worse, another fucking delay. It's a never-ending cycle of excitement and disappointment. Creativity thrives on sharing and evolving through feedback. By keeping so much to himself, he's not only depriving us but also stifling his own growth as an artist. It's frustrating beyond belief. Bro, just drop the tracks. Let the world hear.
