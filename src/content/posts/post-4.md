Fujimoto Tatsuki's "Chainsaw Man" just hits different. Unlike most manga where there's just constant yapping, "Chainsaw Man" hooks you with every single page. ‘Absolute cinema’ as it stands, when reading it is actually like watching a movie, where the characters' expressions shine through vividly and the dialogues are sharp and to the point.

What makes Chainsaw Man stand out is its unique art style. Fujimoto's artwork is simple yet striking, focusing more on characters and their raw emotions rather than intricate backgrounds. Though, the world-building does take a backseat to the intense focus on characters. Unlike expansive manga universes that meticulously detail every facet of their fictional worlds, Chainsaw Man prioritizes character development and thematic exploration over extensive world-building. The backgrounds are often minimalistic, serving more as a backdrop to the characters rather than as detailed settings in their own right.

The manga's pacing is relentless, driven by its concise dialogue that propels the story forward without any unnecessary filler. It's this directness that keeps you glued to every page, eagerly anticipating what comes next. And while it may not delve deeply into the lore of its world, Chainsaw Man more than compensates with its gripping plot twists and intense character development.

Fujimoto's bold artistic choices complement the manga's dark themes perfectly. The visceral nature of his drawings brings out the gritty, grotesque aspects of the story, making each scene visually impactful. It's a manga that doesn't hold back, delivering a visceral experience that lingers long after you've put it down.

This manga is for those who crave storytelling that's memorable and unconventional. Fujimoto Tatsuki has crafted something truly special here, a manga that defies expectations in every chapter and leaves a lasting impression with its daring narrative and distinctive artistic flair.
